# Portfolio Projects
This repository contains self-initiated data science projects aimed at enhancing my expertise in project-based learning.

**Stock Price Prediction**

**Description:<br>**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze stock price trends over time, develop a predictive model to forecast closing prices, evaluate its performance using key metrics, and derive actionable insights through data visualization.

**Skills:**
Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, correlation, linear regression, performance metrices, cross validation.

**Technology:**
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

**Result:**
Python functions are used to analyze the data and predict the closing price. The model generalized well and was able to predict the values close to the actuals.

**Ensemble-Based Customer Purchase Prediction for Travel Package Marketing**

**Description:<br>**
The objective was to support the marketing team in segmenting and targeting customers efficiently, using predictive analytics rooted in past customer behavior, demographics, and transactional data. The ensemble approach combined the predictive strengths of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression models through stacking to improve accuracy and minimize overfitting.

**Skills:**
Predictive Modeling, EDA, Feature Engineering, Bivariate Analysis, Model Evaluation, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBooster, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Stacking

**Technology:**
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib

**Result:**
1. Customers with passports, from tier 1/3 cities, and those who received more follow-ups are more likely to purchase—targeted strategies should focus on these segments.<br>
2. High-income professionals, couples, families, and tier 2 city residents are less responsive—offering customized or luxury packages and expanding outreach may improve conversions.

**Company Employees - SQL Project**

**Description:<br>**
HR analytics, also referred to as people analytics, workforce analytics, or talent analytics, involves gathering together, analyzing, and reporting HR data. It is the collection and application of talent data to improve critical talent and business outcomes. It enables your organization to measure the impact of a range of HR metrics on overall business performance and make decisions based on data. They are primarily responsible for interpreting and analyzing vast datasets.

[Employee Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/JD-Insight/AI-ML-SQL-Projects-2024/tree/main/Advanced%20SQL%20for%20Analysis)

**Skills:<br>**
Core SQL -- Data Retrieving, Data Cleaning and Filtering, Handling NULLs, Sorting and Grouping, Aggregate Functions<br>
Advanced Querying -- Joins, Case Statement, Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions<br>
Data Modeling and Management -- Constraints, Views, Temporary Tables<br>
Procedural SQL -- Stored Procedures, Triggers<br>

**Technology:**
Python, SQL, PostGreSQL

**Product Sales Data Analysis**

**Description:<br>**
The dataset contains a list of sales records along with other relevant informations. This sales data analysis project explores analyzing a company's sales data and indicating profit by product, sales, and other significant factors that might influence the company's performance.
